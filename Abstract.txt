Navigation is an approach which primarily concentrates on the process of tracking and directing the movement of person or vehicle from one place to another.
The purpose of navigation is to locate the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. and to arrive at the point of destination.
College campus is a huge infrastructure and it consists of many departments and blocks.
Therefore, it is very difficult to find the location of the desired destination given by the user.
The existing systems for navigation use Global Positioning System (GPS) for locating different places.
However, in the absence of GPS connectivity it would be difficult for navigation.


This project aims at designing and developing a campus navigator system which can work even in the absence of GPS connectivity. 
The system will have the hand-held device which automatically locates the user location and updates it to the user. 
Based on the destination inputs given by the user,
the system determines the shortest path to the desired destination of the user.


The device consists of Arduino, which controls the entire system.
It includes Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter and receiver module.
The RF transmitter module transmits the location information of different blocks to the receiver module. 
The information transmitted is decoded and analyzed in Arduino and displayed over liquid-crystal display (LCD). 
The device also displays the instructions to the user to reach the destination.
